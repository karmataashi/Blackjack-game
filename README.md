Simple Blackjack Game Using Vanilla JavaScript

This is a basic implementation of the classic Blackjack game built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, competing against the dealer. The game features card drawing, score calculation, and basic game logic. Itâ€™s a straightforward and fun project that showcases core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, and conditional logic.
